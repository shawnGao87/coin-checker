## To start the app:

`npm start`
App will start at localhost:3000

\*A basic data table displaying some information from the API.

\*Columns are sortable by clicking on the header.

\*Pagination at the bottom.

\*The the form on the top is a "filter". (I did not spend time on validating the input for this form).

\*The data in the data table will change as you change the input in the form.

\*Detail link will bring you to the individual "Coin" detail page, where there's a line chart plotting the price over the past 7 days (I could implement another filter to let the user specify the time period, but I didn't since I did it on the home page).
